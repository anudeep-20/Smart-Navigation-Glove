1.) Go to File > Examples > ArduinoISP and open that example
2.) Upload that Example into your Arduino Uno
3.) Go to Tools > Programmer and select "Arduino as ISP"
4.) Go to Tools > Boards :: Set Attiny85 @ 8MHz(Internal oscillator; BOD disabled)
5.) Now make the following Connections

	Arduino Uno ---> ATtiny85

	Vcc -> Pin 8 (5V Pin)
	Gnd -> Pin 4 (Gnd Pin)
	Digital Pin 10 -> Pin 1 (Reset Pin)
	Digital Pin 11 -> Pin 5 (Digital Pin 0 / PWM)
	Digital Pin 12 -> Pin 6 (Digital Pin 1 / PWM)
	Digital Pin 13 -> Pin 7 (Digital Pin 2 / A1)

6.) Go to Tools and click "Burn Bootloader"
7.) Now At-tiny85 is ready for programming and you can upload your code...
