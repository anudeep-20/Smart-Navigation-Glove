Description:

Due to the increasing urbanization, new routes are being created every day and remembering
each route is a tiresome job. In order to make this task easier maps have been created but most of the
riders feel inconvenient to constantly pick their phone up and check for the route. Frequent navigation
checks on the roads while driving increases their travel time and may also cause accidents due to the
distraction by phone. For an instance, let us consider that a food delivery person is out for a delivery to
an unfamiliar place so the driver tends to make navigation checks for knowing the route which causes
discomfort to the driver and he may even run out of the delivery time. Even most of the cab drivers
face similar difficulty during their pickups and droppings. In order to overcome this problem, we have
designed a pair of gloves using IoT and Android Application which is capable of navigating the riders
by glowing the corresponding glove according to the turn to be taken. This can greatly reduce the
burden on the drivers who constantly check for their route.
